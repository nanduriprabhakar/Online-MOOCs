    "## 4. Export your query results to a text file \n",
    "\n",
    "Next week, we will learn how to complete some basic forms of data analysis in SQL.  However, if you know how to use other analysis or visualization software like Excel or Tableau, you can implement these analyses with the SQL skills you have gained already, as long as you can export the results of your SQL queries in a format other software packages can read.  Almost every database interface has a different method for exporting query results, so you will need to look up how to do it every time you try a new interface (another place where having a desire to learn new things will come in handy!). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to export your query results using our Jupyter interface.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  You can select and copy the output you see in an output window, and paste it into another program.  Although this strategy is very simple, it only works if your output is very limited in size (since you can only paste 1000 rows at a time).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  You can tell MySQL to put the results of a query into a variable (for our purposes consider a variable to be a temporary holding place), and then use Python code to format the data in the variable as a CSV file (comma separated value file, a .CSV file) that can be downloaded.  When you use this strategy, all of the results of a query will be saved into the variable, not just the first 1000 rows as displayed in Jupyter, even if we have set up Jupyter to only display 1000 rows of the output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we could export query results using the second method.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tell MySQL to put the results of a query into a variable, use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    "variable_name_of_your_choice = %sql [your full query goes here];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you must execute your SQL query all on one line.  So if you wanted to export the list of dog breeds in the dogs table, you could begin by executing:\n",

    ">```python\n",

    "\n",
    "You can also open the file directly from the home page of your Jupyter account.  Behind the scenes, your csv file was written to your directory on the Jupyter server, so you should now see this file listed in your Jupyter account landing page along with the list of your notebooks.
